# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java)

A simple standalone Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. In this game, each player can only use three marks ("X" or "O") to play, adding an interesting twist to the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe mechanics.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Both players take turns marking spots on a 3x3 grid.
- **Limited moves**: Each player can only make three marks on the board, making the game strategic.
- **Console-based**: The game is played in the terminal/console window, making it easy to run without any additional graphical libraries.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends when a player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all spots are filled (draw).
